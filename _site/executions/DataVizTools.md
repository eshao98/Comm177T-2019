### The Data Visualization

Because I'm currently working on a project to look at campaign contributions (over time) from Stanford affiliates, I wanted to use a summary data set I had collected from [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.php?id=D000000750&cycle=2018) (actually using the BeautifulSoup parsing activity from last quarter!) to see what visualization I could come up with to help me along on the project. Here, I started with total contribution data over the years, though I definitely plan to break this down further, since I have data from exactly where campaign contributions went to and where they came from.

### Flourish, Datawrapper.de

Since I had worked a little with Flourish before, I decided to start with Datawrapper. Immediately, I was excited to see that during the data uploading process, Datawrapper had a step to check that it had interpreted the data correctly, an option that I haven't found on Flourish. The interface even color-codes dates in green, text in black, numbers in blue, and draws attention to cells with missing data. I've definitely faced obstacles on Flourish with mis-interpreted data, so I appreciated this touch.
