        <h1>The Bay Area’s housing affordability crisis gets worse.</h1>
        <h3>Are local governments doing enough to help residents afford housing?</h3>

      <h5>Two weeks ago, lawmakers in California were working on advancing Senate Bill 50, an aggressive plan to combat the housing and rental affordability crisis by increasing the housing density near areas of mass transit and in neighborhoods previously zoned for single-family homes. However, following a period of active lobbying by suburban homeowners, a bout of heated  committee hearings and intense debate both inside Congress and out, the ambitious bill was ultimately killed by state legislature. </h5>

      <p>The state — home to nearly a quarter of the U.S.’s homeless population and a Silicon Valley median home price tag of $1.2 million — continues to struggle with finding a solution to its housing crisis, especially as the Bay Area technology hub continues to expand and as low-income residents become increasingly displaced by wealthier ones who can afford higher rents and home prices. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Stanford University, situated at the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, pushes forth with its expansion as well. If approved by Santa Clara County, the General Use Permit (GUP), which details the University’s 17-year expansion plan into the year 2035, would authorize Stanford to construct 3,150 new housing units for its students, faculty and staff along with 2.275 million square feet of academic facilities.</p> 

      <p>But the University isn’t immune to concerns of affordability. Santa Clara County has imposed an “inclusionary housing” ordinance — which the University has filed a lawsuit against for allegedly violating equal protection laws — requiring Stanford to make 16 percent of its new housing units available at an affordable housing cost. Affordability specifically for campus service workers — many of whom have to commute from hours away — continues to anchor student group protests and campus worker rallies.

        <p>Serious housing affordability concerns unfolding against a backdrop of technological innovation have become emblematic of the Bay Area. But what does this actually mean for workers trying to make enough to afford housing in the region?</p>

        <p>In some parts of San Francisco, a full-time worker must now earn upwards of $81 per hour in order to afford a modest two-bedroom rental home while spending no more than 30 percent of their income on rent — the widely-used standard for housing costs to be considered “affordable.” The average hourly wage of renters in the country, according to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, is only $16.88.</p> 

        <p>The full-time California minimum wage is $12.00 an hour — at this rate, a worker would need to work more than 80 hours a week to afford just a one-bedroom rental home at the Fair Market Rent (FMR) price.</p>

        <p>While the 94305 zip code, the zip code that houses Stanford, currently has a two-bedroom “housing wage” of $45.19, its neighboring Palo Alto’s two-bedroom housing wage hits $78.27. This number has grown more than $40 since 2011, less than eight years ago.</p>

        <p>These skyrocketing prices are occurring despite many local and state attempts at intervening in efforts to develop affordable housing. California state law mandated that local governments must incorporate policies “that promote new housing development based on identification from the California Department of Housing and Community Development.” The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) have defined a Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for jurisdictions in the Bay Area, distributing to each local government a target number of housing units across four different categories: very-low-income housing, low-income housing, moderate-income housing, and above-moderate-income housing. </p>

        <p>Progress reports released by ABAG show that not only are jurisdictions not meeting overall housing construction goals, but that when they do build, they are usually building above-moderate-income housing, and significantly lag behind their target goals for lower-income residents. </p>
